# Apple Terminal Troubleshooting
## Overview
I seem to always run into issues with terminal stuff, whether it is Git, random bash/zsh issues, or me breaking my machine. I seem to fix just about every issue, but some are TOUGH. I created this repo not only for my personal documentation, but to help prevent others from going through the same pain as myself. Please enjoy the content of this repository and if you have any questions or concerns you can reach me by email at ______.
